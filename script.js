const text1 = 'The Monroe Doctrine was created in 1823 as a cornerstone of United States foreign policy by then-President James Monroe. In his annual message to Congress, Monroe articulated the doctrine, outlining the principle that the Americas were to be considered off-limits for further colonization by European powers. The core tenets of the Monroe Doctrine emphasized the U.S. commitment to preventing European interference and expansion in the Western Hemisphere. This policy was, in part, a response to concerns about potential European attempts to regain control over newly independent Latin American nations. The Monroe Doctrine served as a pivotal declaration of the United States intentions to assert its influence in the Americas and became a fundamental aspect of American diplomatic history.'

const text2 = ' John Brown, a fervent abolitionist known for his radical stance against slavery, was hanged on December 2, 1859. His execution took place in Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia). Brown had led a raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry in October 1859, aiming to arm slaves and spark a widespread uprising against slavery. The raid ultimately failed, and Brown was captured by U.S. Marines under the command of then-Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee. Browns trial and subsequent hanging drew significant attention and further deepened the sectional tensions between the Northern and Southern states in the prelude to the American Civil War. While Browns methods were controversial and his raid unsuccessful, he became a symbol for many abolitionists and Northern sympathizers who admired his unwavering dedication to the abolitionist cause.'

This groundbreaking procedure marked a significant milestone in the development of artificial heart technology. The Jarvik-7 was designed to serve as a bridge to transplant for patients awaiting a donor heart. Barney Clark, the recipient, lived for 112 days with the artificial heart, ultimately succumbing to multiple organ failure. While the Jarvik-7 had limitations and was eventually replaced by more advanced devices, this pioneering surgery laid the foundation for subsequent advancements in the field of artificial heart technology and transplantation.'

const text5 = 'Enron, once a leading energy company and symbol of corporate success, filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. The collapse of Enron was a result of widespread financial fraud and accounting scandals that involved the manipulation of financial statements to conceal the companys massive debts and losses. In the years leading up to its bankruptcy, Enron engaged in questionable accounting practices, hiding debt in off-balance-sheet partnerships and inflating profits. As the truth about the companys financial troubles emerged, confidence in Enron evaporated, causing its stock price to plummet. The bankruptcy filing was one of the largest in U.S. history at the time, leading to significant financial losses for investors and employees. The Enron scandal also prompted regulatory reforms and increased scrutiny of corporate governance and accounting practices, shaping the landscape of corporate accountability and ethics in the years that followed.'
